# GenC
> Miguel Abreu, 2013

GenC is an implementation of a genetic algorithm developed in C. The application finds the maximum of a pre-defined function within a set of range values (gene maximum and minimum). The resolution of the solution can be improved by changing the genome size and/or the iterations value.

'log.txt' is a sample output for a generation with 100000 iterations and a 33 bits genome.

* Customizable genes number and resolution
* Customizable genome size
